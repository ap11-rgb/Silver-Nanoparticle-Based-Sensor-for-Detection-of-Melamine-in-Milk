# Silver-Nanoparticle-Based-Sensor-for-Detection-of-Melamine-in-Milk
Final Year Project


## *Project Overview*
This project focuses on the *design and development of a silver nanoparticle-based sensor* for detecting melamine in milk. The sensor uses a *colorimetric detection method*, providing a rapid, cost-effective, and reliable solution for food safety monitoring.

## *Features*
- *Colorimetric sensing* for quick and visible melamine detection.
- *Silver nanoparticle-based detection* ensures high sensitivity.
- *Low-cost and portable approach* for real-time monitoring.
- *UV-Vis spectrophotometric analysis* for precise measurements.

## *Technology Stack*
- *Chemistry & Nanotechnology*: Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) synthesis.
- *Instrumentation*: UV-Vis spectrophotometry for detection.
- *Data Analysis*: Absorbance spectra interpretation.

## *Results*
- Successfully detected melamine at *1 ppm concentration*.
- Achieved *distinct color changes* corresponding to melamine levels.
- Developed a *portable and accessible detection method*.

## *Future Enhancements*
- Improving detection sensitivity below *1 ppm*.
- Expanding the method for *other milk adulterants* (e.g., urea, hydrogen peroxide).
- Developing a *portable device* for on-site testing.
